            <h2 class="About-title">About Me</h2>
            <ul>
              <p>I'm an aspiring web designer and developer who loves everything about what the web can do. I've been lucky enough to travel to lots of different places around the world and have worked lots of different jobs (before getting my teeth stuck into finance). I’m excited to bring my creativity and life experiences to the process of building fantastic websites and applications.</p>
              <p>I have worked in the finance industry for the last 8 years. For the first 4 years, I worked as an investment analyst in a fast-paced boutique investment firm. Over the last 4 years, I have been developping as a trust administrator in a business that has been steadily growing from strength to strength.</p>
              <p>I'm a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
